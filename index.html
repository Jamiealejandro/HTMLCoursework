<h3> Personal Statement </h3>
<p> I am a first year student at Robert Gordon's University, studying computing science. I am looking for apart time position to begin my working career. I am a confident individual, comfortable working alone, I also work well in a team. Having completed the Duke of Edinburgh Bronze and Silver awards, I am now challenging myself as i work for Gold. This has improved my team building skills. It has shown me that i can handle extreme situations with esponsibility and precision. During one of my hikes a life and death situation arose where a team mate collapsed and I had to run several miles to get emergency medical help. I have felt a strong sense of fulfilment in giving something back to my local community whilst volunteering at a Barnardo's shop which has seen an initial 6 month placement last over 4 years. I have built relationships with my co-workers which has helped develop my communication skills. </p>
  <h3> Work Experience </h3>
  <p> June 2015 MOL Energy Uk - a one week work experience placement where I gained valuable experience within a variety of areas in the company, at the end of which I had to make a presentation summarizing what I had learned and what I had gained from the experience </p>
  <p> October 2013 to June 2017 Barnardos Charity shop St Andrews Street Aberdeen- I organised stock, worked on tills and helped any customers with queries and purchases </p>
  <h3> Key I.T. Skills </h3>
  <p> I have worked with Word, Excel and powerpoint and due to the fact that i am studying a computer science bachelors degree, key programming and processing skills will be learnt in the future </p>
